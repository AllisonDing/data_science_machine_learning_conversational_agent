# Conversational ML Agent

A conversational data science and machine learning agent powered by NVIDIA GPUs.  
You can interact with it using natural language to run data exploration and machine learning tasks with minimal setup.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

This project uses the Kaggle [Titanic-Dataset.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset?select=Titanic-Dataset.csv).

Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory before running the agent.

For performance testing, you can also use **Titanic-Dataset-1.csv**, an extrapolated version scaled to 1M rows. This larger dataset is useful for demonstrating GPU acceleration.

## Running the Agent

You can run the agent in two different modes:

### 1. **GPU-Accelerated Mode** (NVIDIA cuML + cuDF)
Leverages NVIDIA's RAPIDS libraries for faster data processing and model training.

python -m cuml.accel --cudf-pandas run.py


---

### 2. **CPU Mode** (scikit-learn + pandas)
Uses standard pandas and scikit-learn for data processing and modeling.

python run.py


---

**Note:**  
- Ensure you have the appropriate dependencies installed for each mode.  
- GPU mode requires a supported NVIDIA GPU and the RAPIDS ecosystem installed.
